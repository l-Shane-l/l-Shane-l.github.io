## Welcome to my GitHub Page

This is my main Github account and most of the projects here are used for learning, with the
exception of three I hope to grow into opensource projects


### Beatspeak
A c++ library designed to record the heartrate of anyone in a video sent to it.

### Driocht
A compiled object orientated language as Gaeilge current writen in go but ultimately will
be converted to C++ and possible use LLVM.

### Ulchabean
An end to end c++ framework for a drone with path finding and environment awareness built in.
